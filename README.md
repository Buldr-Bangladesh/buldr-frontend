## Deployment
This frontend has been deployed on firebase hosting and can't be used in producation. Because our backend can be accessed through http traffic only (Currently doesn't support https traffic because we couldn't get ssl certificate as of now)

## Usage 
Clone this repo on your local machine and run the following commands
```bash
    npm install
```
After that you can run with
```bash
    npm start
```
You can now see most features except for the AI models. For that you'll need to clone our other products
